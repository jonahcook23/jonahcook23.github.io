<h2>About: Volunseeker</h2>
<p1>Project statement<br><br>We are team CRAJ, and we are dedicated to help the world through our product VolunSeeker. Our product will help benefit the world by connecting volunteers to organizations. We want to create a product that will allow organizations to enlist the help of volunteers easily, as well as help people find volunteering opportunities that align with their interests.<br><br>Our goal with this product, VolunSeeker, is to better the world by connecting more volunteers to various volunteering opportunities to improve the world. We want our product to make it simple for volunteers to locate volunteer work they are interested in, using features like a search bar, concise filters, organization tags, and more. In addition, we want to make sure the participating organizations clearly state their purpose and what type of work they want volunteers to do, so that volunteers can be properly informed in order to decide if they want to volunteer. VolunSeeker will benefit those who need help and those who want to help, and in doing so, it will streamline the organization process so those who need help can get it as fast as possible.<br><br>Problem<br><br>The problem is that volunteers sometimes have trouble finding good organizations to volunteer for, whether it be for volunteer hours or out of the very goodness of their heart. They need a convenient and quick way to find volunteering opportunities. Another problem is that organizations can sometimes have a hard time finding volunteers. They need a way to spread publicity so that more volunteers can know about them.<br><br>Interested in volunteering?<a href="profile.html"> Sign up today!</a></p1>
